Description:  |
  This program controls a motor. It uses a start button, a stop button, and a motor output.

Input:
  Start:  A push button to start the motor. True iff it's pressed (normally closed). 
  Stop:   A stop button to stop the motor. True iff it's pressed (normally closed). 

Variable:

Output:
  Motor:  The motor output. True iff it's on.

Rungs:
  - name: Motor Control
    info: |
      1. When the Start button is initially pressed, if the Stop button is not pressed,
          the Motor output will be activated (becomes true).
      2. Even if the Start button is released, the Motor will stay true/on because the rung
          includes a Motor variable connected in parallel.
      3. When the Stop Button is pressed, the Motor output will be deactivated, and stays
          deactivated after the stop button is released since the first clause is not false.

      type:   equal
      # (Start or Motor) and (¬Stop) = Motor
