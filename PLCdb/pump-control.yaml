Description:  |
  It's a controller for a pump that fills a water tank dynamically.
  When the pump is started (not stopped or emergency stopped), it maintains the water level
  so that
  (1) when water is below low level, start the pump;
  (2) when water is above high level, stop the pump.

Input:
  Start:  start push button (momentary)
  Stop:   stop push button
  Emergency:  emergency push button
  HighLevel:  sensor of high water level - true iff higher than threshold
  LowLevel:   sensor of low water level - true iff higher than threshold

Variable:
  Run:  whether machine is on

Output:
  PC: pump control output variable

Rungs:
  - name: Start, stop, emergency button
    info: Classic momentary start/stop implementation with emergency button
    rung:
      Run:  (Start or Run) and (¬Stop) and (¬Emergency)
      type: equal
      # (Start or Run) and (¬Stop) and (¬Emergency) = Run
  - name: High level control
    info: Stop pump when level is above high level switch or process is stopped
    rung:
      PC: HighLevel or (¬Run)
      type: reset
      # HighLevel or (¬Run) ==> ¬PC
  - name: Low level control
    info: Start pump when level is below low level switch (or process stopped)
    rung:
      PC: Run and (¬LowLevel)
      type: set
      # Run and (¬LowLevel) ==> PC

# Master CNF of the 3 rungs above, basically the AND of those 3 CNFs.
CNF: >-
  (¬Start or Stop or Emergency or Run) and 
  (¬Stop or ¬Run) and 
  (¬Emergency or ¬Run) and 
  (¬HighLevel or ¬PC) and 
  (Run or ¬PC) and 
  (¬Run or Lowlevel or PC)
