"""
This script converts master CNFs into a bipartite graph, in NetworkX format,
for further graph induction algorithms.
Note that the two are already equivalent, i.e., have a bijection between them.
It writes the resulting NetworkX into [db_file_name].gpickle, which can be
read with graph = pickle.load(open('filename.pickle', 'rb')).

Run `python CNF2networkx.py [db_file.yaml]` in cmd line.
The following packages are needed: `pyyaml`, `networkx`, `boolean.py`.
