## Less Important Misc
- Cute [article](https://www.controldesign.com/displays/hmi/article/11309970/open-source-plc-and-hmi-library-makes-headway) on DMC's view on open-sourcing PLC code and their collab with Siemens. Another [one](https://www.dmcinfo.com/latest-thinking/case-studies/view/id/273/mitsubishi-plc-standard-library) with Mitsubishi here.
- [IEEE paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4278362_A_Study_of_Industrial_Logic_Control_Programming_using_Library_Components) on some observations (using function blocks, code for things other than automation) in the automobile industry.
