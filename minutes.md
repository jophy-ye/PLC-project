# Meeting Minutes
## Summer UROP 2024 with Wojceich Matusik & Michael Sun


## June 27 Thu
Fourth weekly check-in with Michael.
- Presented PLCdb/pump_control

TODO:
- [ ] Master CNF (maybe helpful https://mamo.dev/first-order-logic-tool)
- [ ] Come up with examples in the factory robotics setting.
- [ ] Access TIA Portal from Siemens


## June 21 Fri
Unfortunately progress has been slow.
- Turns out, Simulink cannotÂ (verify?) read other formats of other proprietary software but can write.
- Contacted & cc'ed Siemens (for TIA) and Rockwell (for Studio 5000).
- Cleared some more tabs.

TODO:
- [x] Just look up "PLC code" on Github


## June 20 Thu
Weekly check-in with Michael:
- Start small; restrict to binary combinactorial logic (leave temporal logic)

TODO:
- [ ] Checkout ðŸ’¾ from last meeting presentation
- [x] Finish manuals & Youtube videos


### June 14 Fri
Finally met Wojciech!
- Presented everything. Michael pointed to the CNF idea.

TODO:
- [ ] Collect a dataset of ~50 PLC codes.
- [x] Look into compiler/simulator (some oracle).
- [x] PLC --> reduced form (CNF / bipartite)
- [ ] Define vocab
- [x] Read CNF paper Michael suggested


### June 13 Thu
30 mins in the morning with Michael
- [x] Present finding on what PLC is and dataset

TODO:
- [x] Read [Graphical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model) and all linked pages.


### June 6 Thu noon
First weekly check-in with Michael
- [x] Background clarification
Q: Why is there a need? What metrics are we optimizing?
A: *Focus more on research & modelling*, as suggested by Michael, but he agrees knowing more is good, specifically:
> Is the environment model-based or model-free, e.g., can there be external changes to the environment (somebody coming in, pour water)?

What we also covered:
- Random walk **concern**
:thumbsup: Can model stochastic execution; :thinking: Can it model the code?
- End goal is still to *design new PLC*

TODO:
- [x] Talk with Wojceich when he's free.


### June 5 Wed evening
With Prof. Matusik & Michael
- [x] Account number needed for UROP faculty funding

TODO:
- [x] Finish reading through Michael's **random walk** paper *in detail*.
- [x] Learn about PLC code & present findings next Mon (June 10) *with slides*.
- [x] Look for open-source PLC datasets.
